# Plans
**Important: This is not the content of the mod, just my plans for it**

## Temporary recepies
These recepies might be in the mod before the more complex features are added

Distillation catalyst x8:
Copper nugget and sugar

Electrolysis catalyst x8:
Iron nugget and sugar

## Fluids

### Spring water
Spring water is found in pools rarely, with similar generation to regular water and lava pools.
It's not renewable and provides an alternative to early game mining, having a rare chance to give diamonds


Distilling spring water gives a chance for these items:

- Iron nugget 7-14
- Gold nugget 7-14
- Cinder flour 1-2
- Sugar 1-4

- Lapis 1-4
- Redstone 1-8
- Raw iron
- Raw gold
- Quartz

- Emerald
- Diamond

### Mineral water
Mineral water is created by mixing together the following items in a heated basin:
- 500mb of water
- 4x iron nugget
- 4x gold nugget
- lapis
- redstone
- Cinder flour


## Mechanisms

### Distillery
Crafted with copper, glass and andesite alloy

When a fluid is in the distiller and a heat source is underneath it, the fluid will be distilled at regular intervals. 
The heat sources are the same as those used for boilers, with the time it takes for distillation halfing with each level:
Fire/campfire - 1s
Heated blaze burner - 0.5s
Superheated blaze burner - 0.25s


### Electrolyser
The electrolyser can be used to convert mineral water into orestones

An electrolyser must be placed below the middle block of a 3x3 fluid tank
For a fluid to begin electrolysing it must start boiling, which must be catalysed by activated blaze burners on the corner blocks of the tank.

The electrolyser must have rotational force to function ==Maybe not?==

The filter slot of the elctrolyser must be filled with an orestone to function, and when filled the top texture also becomes that orestone, the orestone is consumed ==?==

When distillation is active, steam whistles on top of the boiler will activate and swirling orestones will appear in the tank above the electrolyser, or possible growing on the top texture. 
When an orestone has finished generating it enters the inventory of the electrolyser and can be removed with a funnel or chute, it also uses up some of the fluid.


## Recepies

### Sap
Crushing any type of log except pale oak log gives sap.
Distilling sap gives syrup

Crushing pale oak logs gives pale sap
Distilling pale sap gives resin
Spouting pale sap into a pale oak log gives a creaking heart

### Other recepies

Distilling milk gives powdered milk, which can be mixed with water to get the liquid milk back, this acts as a better way to mass-store milk

Distilling lava gives igneous stones which can be superheated back into the lava that created them
==Maybe not this==

Distilling honey gives sugar

Distilling chocolate gives sugar and rarely cocoa beans


## Natural blocks

### Spring stone
Generates in springs
Creates bubbles in water above it that damage the player ==?==
Crushed into igneous stones
